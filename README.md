## Project Overview
This project is a practical MLOps implementation showcasing the building, testing, versioning, and deployment of a machine learning model with **GitLab as both an SCM and CI/CD automation platform**. In comparison to other projects where GitHub and Jenkins or CircleCI were used, this project showcases GitLab's native DevOps features, making it a robust all-in-one enterprise-grade machine learning workflow tool.

The machine learning task's core is a basic model trained on a limited dataset to maintain the focus on deployment, automation, and infrastructure. The model pipeline, after being created and modularized, is containerized with **Docker**, pushed to **Google Container Registry (GCR)**, and deployed to **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** with the help of **GitLab CI/CD pipelines**.

You'll also create a Flask-driven web app to host model predictions through an intuitive interface, supporting real-time input and output for end users.

## Architecture
GitLab CI/CD automates the pipeline from code commit to deployment by building Docker images, pushing them to Google Container Registry (GCR), and deploying them to a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster. This enables seamless, scalable, and containerized ML app deployment directly from source control.

## CI/CD Pipeline Stages
- **Checkout** Code : Fetch the latest code from GitHub.
  Install Dependencies/Python packages from requirements.txt.
  Run Tests / Linting (optional): Perform code quality checks or run test suites.
- **Build** Docker Image using the Dockerfile.
- **Push** the image to Google Container Registry.
- **Deploy** the Docker images/app to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster.
- Expose via LoadBalancer : The app is made available at a public IP endpoint.
  
Pipelines can be triggered manually or automatically on code pushes.

## Project Workflow

1. **Project Setup**
   - Create virtual environments and install dependencies (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib).
   - Organize project structure with folders like `src`, `pipeline`, and `artifacts`.

2. **Jupyter Notebook Testing**
   - Perform data processing, model training, and model selection interactively in a notebook.

3. **Modular Code Development**
   - Convert notebook steps into modular code using classes and methods for better maintainability.

4. **User Application**
   - Build a simple user interface using Flask and basic HTML.

5. **Training Pipeline**
   - Combine data processing and model training into a single Python script for streamlined execution.

6. **Data and Code Versioning**
   - Use GitHub for data and code versioning (suitable for small datasets).
   - Optionally use DVC for large datasets.

7. **Google Cloud Setup**
   - Enable required GCP APIs.
   - Create a Kubernetes cluster on GCP.
   - Set up artifact repositories and service accounts with necessary permissions.
   - Create in vscode docker file, kubernetes deployment configuration file
  
8. **GitLab Setup**
   - Create Project and push the code
   - Create Gitlab CICD configuration file in vscode
   - Environment Variables Configuration i.e., GCP-key
   - Test Pipeline with Trigger

## Future Enhancements
- Enable automatic model retraining with updated datasets.  
- Add model versioning using DVC or MLflow.  
- Integrate monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
- Automate GCP infrastructure using Terraform.
- Log all model predictions for auditing and compliance.
