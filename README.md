## Project Overview
This project is a practical MLOps implementation showcasing the building, testing, versioning, and deployment of a machine learning model with **GitLab as both an SCM and CI/CD automation platform**. In comparison to other projects where GitHub and Jenkins or CircleCI were used, this project showcases GitLab's native DevOps features, making it a robust all-in-one enterprise-grade machine learning workflow tool.

The machine learning task's core is a basic **Support Vector Machine (SVM) model** trained on a limited dataset to maintain the focus on deployment, automation, and infrastructure. The model pipeline, after being created and modularized, is containerized with **Docker**, pushed to **Google Container Registry (GCR)**, and deployed to **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** with the help of **GitLab CI/CD pipelines**.

You'll also create a Flask-driven web app to host model predictions through an intuitive interface, supporting real-time input and output for end users.

## Project Workflow

1. **Project Setup**: Virtual environment, modular folder structure, logging & exception setup.
2. **Notebook Testing**: Run exploratory code in Jupyter to finalize model & preprocessing logic.
3. **Modular Code Implementation**: Move logic to classes/methods for production readiness.
4. **Flask App Development**: Create user-friendly UI for predictions.
5. **Training Pipeline**: Unified script for data processing & model training.
6. **Code & Data Versioning**: Use GitLab repositories (instead of GitHub/DVC).
7. **GCP Setup**: Create service accounts, container registry, Kubernetes cluster.
8. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Use `.gitlab-ci.yml` to automate build → test → deploy process.
9. **Deployment**: Dockerize app → Push to GCR → Deploy to GKE via GitLab pipeline.
